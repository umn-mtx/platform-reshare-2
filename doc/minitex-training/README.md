# Minitex training session
This document provides the examples used in the training sessions. The goals in these sessions are to set up a ReShare system and understand the key concepts of the underlying platform. This document shows an example install, but is not necessarily meant to be a guide for best practice installation in a production environment. 

The order of operations here is geared towards wading into reshare administration more than an efficient setup procedure. The end result should be a ReShare system running in a Kubernetes namespace. This includes the ReShare components such as the crosslink broker, reservoir, and directory module. It also includes the user login subsystem from FOLIO, and any infrastructure necessary to support these systems.

## Prerequisites

### Kubernetes namespace
The kubernetes namespace provides logical separation from other areas in the Kubernetes cluster. Create a new [kubernetes namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/core/namespace-v1/) for the session. We'll call the namespace "reshare" in this example. From the cluster flux repository create a directory and copy the [namespace manifest](./manifests/reshare/reshare-namespace.yaml) into the new namespace directory.


### Chart Repositories
We'll take advantage of a number of Helm charts to deploy software. Configure a helm repository for the included charts. In this example, repositories are in the "flux-system" namespace. We put them in the "helm-repos" directory in the flux control repository for convenience. Create the helm-repos directory and add the following manifests:
* [bitnami helm repository](./manifests/helm-repos/bitnami-charts.yaml)
* [indexdata public helm repository](./manifests/helm-repos/idgithub-public.yaml)
* [Okapi helm repository](./manifests/helm-repos/okapi.yaml)


### Data Storage: Postgresql
The ReShare project uses the postgres database for data persistence. We will provision an number of databases and roles. To begin, we need a database for our module data. This database will support N number of ReShare tenants. We also will need a database for [Okapi](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi). Okapi is a proxy and api gateway server which will provide an entrypoint to the software in the ReShare system. 

In this guide, postgres is deployed as a helm chart backed by persistent volumes. The Chart is minimally configured with values to create a module and okapi database. Create a "charts" directory and put the [postgres](./manifests/reshare/charts/postgres.yaml) chart in there. Inspect the chart's values and take note of the database creation script. Credentials are included there for demonstration purposes.

Various components of the ReShare system will need postgres credentials. Store them in a secret at the root of the namespace. Copy the [db-secrets.yaml](./manifests/reshare/db-secrets.yaml) into the root of the "reshare" namespace directory. Inspect the manifest and note the credentials.


### Checkpoint: commit and deploy
At this point the flux cluster control repository should include these items. Commit them and make sure they come up.
```
.
├── helm-repos
│   ├── bitnami-charts.yaml
│   └── idgithub-public.yaml
│   └── okapi.yaml
└── reshare
    ├── charts
    │   └── postgres.yaml
    ├── db-secrets.yaml
    └── reshare-namespace.yaml
```
After flux has picked up the changes, you should be able to see your resources using the kubectl tool. For example:
Show the running pods
```
$ kubectl -n reshare get pods
```
```
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
resharedb-postgresql-0   1/1     Running   0             38m
```
Check that the secret was created, and tail the postgres logs.

### Okapi
[Okapi](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi) is the API gateway and proxy server that provides a unified entrypoint to most ReShare components. Okapi can be deployed from a chart. Copy the [okapi.yaml](./manifests/reshare/charts/okapi.yaml) chart into the "charts" repository. Take a look at the configured values. Note the database credentials. *Commit the Okapi chart*, and verify the statefulset comes up. At this point, create an environment variable with your okapi hostname:

```
export okapi=https://myokapi.mydomain.tld
```

Once Okapi is up we'll need to populate it with module descritpors. We'll do this two ways. First we'll use a special feature to sync all available module descriptors from the FOLIO project to our Okapi. This way we have definitions for all FOLIO modules:

```
echo '{"urls" : [ "https://folio-registry.dev.folio.org" ]}' | http POST $okapi/_/proxy/pull/modules
```

### Secure Okapi
The Okapi supertenant is the default tenant. Enable the authentication subsystem on the supertenant to secure the okapi APIs. The process of securing the supertnant follows these steps:
1. Deploy users, login, permissions, and authentication modules.
1. Enable all modules on the supertenant except for the authentication module.
1. Create a user, permissions, and credential record (at this point, the APIs are still unsecured).
1. Enable the authentication module to enforce the use of an authentication token.
For

Begin by deploying the required software in the reshare namespace. Copy the "auth-modules" directory into the root of the flux control repository. Inspect the manifests there. For each module, there are two manifests, a deployment and a service. The deployment creates a pod, and the service creates a route to that pod. In the deployment manifest, note that the modules get their database credentials from the shared database secret created by the db-secrets.yaml manifest at the root of the reshare namespace.

### Checkpoint: Okapi and login software
A this point, the flux control repository should include these files:
```
.
├── helm-repos
│   ├── bitnami-charts.yaml
│   └── idgithub-public.yaml
│   └── okapi.yaml
└── reshare
    ├── auth-modules
    │   ├── mod-authtoken-2.16.2
    │   │   ├── deployment.yaml
    │   │   └── service.yaml
    │   ├── mod-login-7.12.1
    │   │   ├── deployment.yaml
    │   │   └── service.yaml
    │   ├── mod-permissions-6.6.1
    │   │   ├── deployment.yaml
    │   │   └── service.yaml
    │   └── mod-users-19.6.0
    │       ├── deployment.yaml
    │       └── service.yaml
    ├── charts
    │   ├── okapi.yaml
    │   └── postgres.yaml
    ├── db-secrets.yaml
    └── reshare-namespace.yaml
```
Commit these and let flux pick up the changes. Check that the pods are running, and look at the services that were created:
```
kubectl -n reshare get svc
```
These are the internal addresses for the modules that were just deployed. The will be used in the next steps.

### Secure Okapi, continued
All software for securing Okapi is running on kubernetes. Module descriptors were pulled from the FOLIO registry. To make Okapi aware of the instances of these modules running on kubernetes, post a deployment descriptor for each module. Use the post-deployment-descriptors.py script to create the descriptors:
```
python3 scripts/post-deployment-descriptors.py -o $okapi -d resources/1-supertenant/deployment-descriptors/
```

Finally, use the secure-supertenant.py script to bootstrap a superuser:
```
python3 scripts/secure-supertenant.py -u okapi_admin  -o $okapi
```
Try logging in to the supertenant, and save a token
```
http POST $okapi/authn/login username=okapi_admin password=okapiadmin123
```
```
export token=my.okapi.token
```

## Reservoir
Reservoir is deployed on a new tenant. In a typical ReShare configuration, there is one instance of reservoir that serves a consortium. Reservoir is on its own tenant, and each institution has a tenant for the ReShare software. This section walks through creating the Reservoir tenant manually.

### Create a new tenant for Reservoir
```
cat resources/2-reservoir/tenant.json | http POST $okapi/_/proxy/tenants "x-okapi-token:$token"
```
The `/_/proxy/tenants` api should now list two tenants, the supertnant, and the new reservoir tenant.

### Deploy the reservoir software
Reservoir is deployed from a chart. Copy the "reservoir.yaml" file into the charts directory of the reshare namespace and commit the change. Next, post the module descriptor and deployment descriptors:
```
cat resources/2-reservoir/reservoir-md.json | http POST $okapi/_/proxy/modules "x-okapi-token:$token"
```
```
cat resources/2-reservoir/reservoir-dd.json | http POST $okapi/_/discovery/modules "x-okapi-token:$token"
```
All the software required for the reservoir tenant is now deployed. Its [listed](resources/2-reservoir/install.json) in the `resources/2-reservoir/install.json` file. We can enable all module simultaneously by using Okapi's [install](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md#install-modules-per-tenant) api. Its useful to simulate an install first to confirm that all required software is present.
```
cat resources/2-reservoir/install.json | http POST $okapi/_/proxy/tenants/reservoir/install?simulate=true
```
If the the response reflects the set of modules in the install file, remove the "simulate" query parameter and enable the required modules for the reservoir tenant.
```
cat resources/2-reservoir/install.json | http POST $okapi/_/proxy/tenants/reservoir/install
```

### Create a superuser for the reservoir tenant
There are no users on the reservoir tenant. Additionally, mod-authtoken is enabled so it is completely locked off. We can bootstrap a superuser using a script to disable mod-authtoken then create a user, permissions user, and login credential before re-enabling mod-authtoken. Run the bootstrap-tenant-admin.py script.
```
python3 scripts/create-tenant-admin.py -o $okapi -u okapi_admin -a reservoir_admin -t reservoir
```
## ReShare Tenants
The ReShare tenants used by ILL staff to manage loans are comprised of the ReShare software plus a base set of FOLIO modules to provide authn/z, user management, and mail. 

Begin by cloning the [reshare-ui](https://github.com/indexdata/reshare-ui) into the "repos" directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/indexdata/reshare-ui.git repos/reshare-ui
```
We will be using this repository to build the front end webpack, and enable the remaining base modules on the ReShare tenant.

Begin by creating a new tenant for reshare. In this example, the tenant id is "rs1"

```
cat resources/3-reshare/tenant.json | http POST $okapi/_/proxy/tenants
```

### FOLIO module deployment
The remaining FOLIO modules are in the `./manifests/reshare/modules` directory. Copy them into your flux control repository. 

Add the deployment descriptors form the `./resources/3-reshare/deployment-descriptors` directory:

```
python3 scripts/post-deployment-descriptors.py -o $okapi -u okapi_admin -p okapiadmin123 -d resources/3-reshare/deployment-descriptors/
```

#### ReShare Chart Manifests
We will enable the directory, and broker modules on the ReShare tenants. This software is deployed using charts. These charts have the capability to include the okapi hooks chart as a dependency. Okapi hooks automates the Okapi communication for these modules. To use okapi hooks, we need to first create a secret with the okapi credentials. Copy the "okapi-secrets.yaml" secret from `./manifests/reshare/okapi-secrets.yaml` into the root of your flux control repository.

We will deploy the optional crosslink-illmock chart to mock all integration we may want to test. It requires a directory configuration. Copy the `./manifests/reshare/directory-configmap.yaml` manifest into the root of your flux control repository.

Finally, copy the broker.yaml, directory.yaml, and mock.yaml charts from `./manifests/reshare/charts` into the charts directory of your flux control repository.

### Checkpoint: Deploy
At this point, your flux control repository should include the following manifests:
```
.
├── auth-modules
│   ├── mod-authtoken-2.16.2
│   │   ├── deployment.yaml
│   │   └── service.yaml
│   ├── mod-login-7.12.1
│   │   ├── deployment.yaml
│   │   └── service.yaml
│   ├── mod-permissions-6.6.1
│   │   ├── deployment.yaml
│   │   └── service.yaml
│   └── mod-users-19.6.0
│       ├── deployment.yaml
│       └── service.yaml
├── charts
│   ├── broker.yaml
│   ├── directory.yaml
│   ├── mock.yaml
│   ├── okapi.yaml
│   ├── postgres.yaml
│   └── reservoir.yaml
├── db-secrets.yaml
├── directory-configmap.yaml
├── reshare-namespace.yaml
├── modules
│   ├── mod-configuration-5.11.0
│   │   ├── deployment.yaml
│   │   └── service.yaml
│   ├── mod-notes-6.0.0
│   │   ├── deployment.yaml
│   │   └── service.yaml
│   ├── mod-password-validator-3.3.0
│   │   ├── deployment.yaml
│   │   └── service.yaml
│   ├── mod-settings-1.1.0
│   │   ├── deployment.yaml
│   │   └── service.yaml
│   ├── mod-tags-2.3.0
│   │   ├── deployment.yaml
│   │   └── service.yaml
│   └── mod-users-bl-7.9.4
│       ├── deployment.yaml
│       └── service.yaml
└── okapi-secret.yaml
```

Commit them and let flux pick up the changes. You should be able to see that the Okapi Hooks job completed and enabled the reshare software on your tenant. Check the enabled software on the new rs1 tenant:

```
http $okapi/_/proxy/tenants/rs1/modules
```

### UI Build
To build the UI, change into the `repos/reshare-ui` directory, and run:
```
yarn install
```

Since UI modules also have module descriptors, we need to post the descriptors for the UI mods to Okapi. From the reshare-ui repo, run:
```
yarn build-module-descriptors
```
This will build a module descriptor for each UI module in the ModuleDescriptors directory. Change into the ModuleDescriptors directory and post them to Okapi:
```
for f in project*; do cat $f | http POST $okapi/_/proxy/modules "x-okapi-token:$token"; done
```

Finally, build the webpack. From the `repos/reshare-ui/platform-rs-dev` directory run:
```
yarn build --okapi $okapi --tenant rs1
```
This should create an "output" directory with the freshly built webpack.

### Enable software for the ReShare tenant
Enable the remaining modules. They are listed in the "install.json" file in the platform-rs-dev directory. Begin by simulating an install to ensure the dependencies resolve for all modules:

```
cat install.json | http POST "$okapi/_/proxy/tenants/rs1/install?simulate=true" "x-okapi-token:$token"
```

If the list of modules returned by the simulated install matches the list in install.json, proceed to enable modules:

```
cat install.json | http POST "$okapi/_/proxy/tenants/rs1/install?tenantParameters=loadReference%3Dtrue" "x-okapi-token:$token"
```
Note that the install call includes the [tenant parameter "loadReference"](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md#tenant-parameters). 


### Create admin for ReShare Tenant
Create an admin for the new tenant using the create-tenant-admin.py script:
```
python3 scripts/create-tenant-admin.py -o $okapi -u okapi_admin -a rs1admin -t rs1
```
After the administrator has been configured, log in and make sure things look OK in your new tenant.

### UI Nginx container
The UI can be served in a number of ways. For this demo, we'll build an image with nginx and the output of the webpack. Begin by copying the output directory:
```
cp -a repos/reshare-ui/platform-rs-dev/output resources/3-reshare/output
```

Change into the resources directory and build a docker image:
```
cd resources/3-reshare
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Stripes-Dockerfile -t stripes-minitex-training:latest .
```
From here, publish the image to a repository that your kubernetes cluster can pull from. This could be the public docker.io registry, AWS ECR, or something else.

Copy the manifests/reshare/nginx directory into the root of your flux control repository. Edit the image line to point to the repository where you published your nginx image. This is a simple deployment and service for a stripes container. Note: you will need to create an ingress to reach this from outside your Kubernetes cluster. 

As an alternative, serve the webpack from your local machine:
```
cd resources/3-reshare/output
python3 -m http.server
```

At this point, you should be able to log in to the UI using the tenant administrator created in the previous step.

## Configure multiple tenants
In order to test the ReShare system, multiple tenants are required. This section covers deploying and configuring multiple tenants. Some steps from the guide up to this point are modified and consolidated here.

### Disable directory chart
For this setup, we will use the crosslink-illmock application as the directory service, and to mock all integrations. Disable the directory application on the rs1 tenant if enabled. In the directory chart, change okapi-hooks.enabled to false:
```
    okapi-hooks:
      tenants:
      - rs1
      enabled: false
      moduleUrl: http://directory:8086
```
Commit the changes, and disable the directory module on the rs1 tenant:
```
echo '[{"id","directory","action":"disable}]' | http POST $okapi/_/proxy/tenants/rs1/install "x-okapi-token:$token"
```

### Create additional tenants

Create two additional tenants:
```
cat resources/4-multi-tenant-reshare/rs2.json | http POST $okapi/_/proxy/tenants "x-okapi-token:$token"
cat resources/4-multi-tenant-reshare/rs3.json | http POST $okapi/_/proxy/tenants "x-okapi-token:$token"
```
### Enable modules for new tenants
Modify the broker and mock charts to add the new rs2 and rs2 tenants to the the `values.okapi-hooks.tenants` config:
```
  values:
    replicaCount: 1
    okapi-hooks:
      tenants:
      - rs1
      - rs2
      - rs3
```
Commit the new configuration to the flux control repository to enable the broker and mock.

Enable the remaining modules:
```
cat repose/reshare-ui/platform-rs-dev/install.json | http POST "$okapi/_/proxy/tenants/rs2/install?tenantParameters=loadReference%3Dtrue" "x-okapi-token:$token"
cat repose/reshare-ui/platform-rs-dev/install.json | http POST "$okapi/_/proxy/tenants/rs3/install?tenantParameters=loadReference%3Dtrue" "x-okapi-token:$token"
```

#### optional alternative module enable trick
You can also duplicate the set of enabled modules on rs1 on the other two tenants by asking Okpai what modules are enabled on rs1 and sending the list to rs2 and rs3. This is a one liner that gets the list of modules, formats it as an "install" command and posts to the new tenant.
```
http $okapi/_/proxy/tenants/rs1/modules "x-okapi-token:$token" | jq '[.[] + {"action":"enable"}]' | http POST "$okapi/_/proxy/tenants/rs2/install?tenantParameters=loadReference%3Dtrue" "x-okapi-token:$token"
```
### Create administrative users on new tenants
Use the create-tenant-admin.py script to create new users:
```
python3 scripts/create-tenant-admin.py -o $okapi -u okapi_admin -a rs2_admin -t rs2
python3 scripts/create-tenant-admin.py -o $okapi -u okapi_admin -a rs3_admin -t rs3

```
### Okapi Aliases
When using multiple UIs pointing to the same Okapi, its useful to give Okapi an alias for each tenant. If multiple web packs are built with the same Okapi URL users may run into UI errors when switching between front ends if the browser caches and sends the x-okapi-token from a different UI. In the Okapi chart, specify multiple aliases for the same application in the ingress section. 
```
    ingress:
      className: traefik
      annotations:
        external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target: "k8s-kubesyst-foliodev-111111111111-11111111111.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "10000m"
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "300"
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-request-buffering: "off"
      hosts:
        - host: minitex-training-okapi.reshare-dev.indexdata.com
          paths:
            - path: /
              pathType: Prefix
        - host: rs1-minitex-okapi.reshare-dev.indexdata.com
          paths:
            - path: /
              pathType: Prefix
        - host: rs2-minitex-okapi.reshare-dev.indexdata.com
          paths:
            - path: /
              pathType: Prefix
        - host: rs3-minitex-okapi.reshare-dev.indexdata.com
          paths:
            - path: /
              pathType: Prefix
```
Be sure to update the annotations and host names for ingress controllers and addresses specific to your cluster.

### Build additional UI bundles
Change into the `repos/reshare-ui/platform-rs-dev` directory and build three new webpacks. These should use the Okapi aliases created in the last step. For example:
```
yarn build --okapi https://rs1-minitex-okapi.reshare-dev.indexdata.com --tenant rs1 && mv output rs1
yarn build --okapi https://rs2-minitex-okapi.reshare-dev.indexdata.com --tenant rs1 && mv output rs2
yarn build --okapi https://rs3-minitex-okapi.reshare-dev.indexdata.com --tenant rs1 && mv output rs3
```
Copy the web packs into the `resources/4-multi-tenant-reshare` directory. A modified Dockerfile and nginx config are supplied to serve all three web packs. from the `resources/4-multi-tenant-reshare` directory build a new image:

```
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Stripes-Dockerfile -t stripes-minitex-training:latest .
```
and push it to your docker repository replacing the previous build. Restart the nginx container to pull in the latest image:
```
kubectl -n reshare rollout restart deployment nginx
```
Finally, update the ingress.yaml to direct traffic for all three UI webpacks to the nginx container:
```
spec:
  ingressClassName: traefik
  rules:
  - host: rs1-minitex.reshare-dev.indexdata.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: nginx
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: Prefix
  - host: rs2-minitex.reshare-dev.indexdata.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: nginx
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: Prefix
  - host: rs3-minitex.reshare-dev.indexdata.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: nginx
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: Prefix
```
### Checkpoint: visit new UIs and log in with admin accounts
At this point, check your work by visiting the new UIs for the rs2 and rs3 tenants. Be sure you can log in with the newly created admin accounts. If you get a 403 error on the login endpoint in the console or the administrator account was not found, check that the new modules were built using the proper okapi alias for the tenant.

### Add directory entries and configure settings
Most per tenant configurations are handled in the directory entries. In this environment, we are using the crosslink-illmock to serve the directory as a flat file. Inspect the sample directory information at `resources/4-multi-tenant-reshare/sample-directory.json`. The lmsConfig section handles settings related to how requests interact with the ILS. For example `requestItemRequestType` is set to use "Page" as the default request type. The API for the directory is described here: https://github.com/indexdata/crosslink/blob/main/directory/api.yaml. We can put the sample directory into our directory-configmap.yaml manifest and restart the illmock deployment to configure settings for this environment.

### Configure mock integrations
For this environment, all integrations are handles by the mock. To set this up, the `lmsConfig.address` config in the directory will point to the crosslink-illmock's ncip service.
```
    "lmsConfig": {
      "address": "http://crosslink-illmock:80/ncip",
```

The broker also needs to be configured to be configured to use the mock for the holdings adapter, ISO18626 client, and directory api. The following environment variables should be set on the broker:

```
# holdings adapter
HOLDINGS_ADAPTER: sru
SRU_URL: http://crosslink-illmock/sru
# ISO18626 client
MOCK_CLIENT_URL: http://crosslink-illmock:80/iso18626
# Directory
DIRECTORY_ADAPTER: api
DIRECTORY_API_URL: http://crosslink-illmock:80/directory/entries
```

### Place requests in the ReShare UI
At this point it should be possible to create and service requests in the UI. Log into one of the ReShare UI tenants and use the ILL Request > Create Patron Request form to create a new request. Fill in required fields with dummy values "test" is fine. for the System Identifier, we need to enter a special string that will be prompt the desired response. This is documented in the illmock here: https://github.com/indexdata/crosslink/blob/main/illmock/README.md#sru-service.

Use a string with the pattern `return-$s::$l` as the ID. For example `return-ISIL:US-RS3::123` tells the mock to respond with a mocked holding belonging to the US-RS3 tenant with a local identifier of 123.

### Add basic auth ingress to expose debugging services
There are some useful debugging features on the mock and broker. You may chose to expose those beyond the cluster and protecting them with some kind of authentication system. In this example we'll use basic auth for both services. To do this we'll need to create another ingress and protect it with basic auth. Begin by creating an auth secret. Use this command to create a secret called "auth" for the user "minitex":
```
htpasswd -c auth minitex
```
Base 64 encode the result:
```
cat auth | base64
```
Copy the `resources/4-multi-tenant-reshare/basic-auth.yaml` and `resources/4-multi-tenant-reshare/auth-ingress.yaml` manifests into the reshare namespace in your flux control and edit them with values that correspond to your custer. replace the secret in basic-auth.yaml with the base64 encoded secret from your previous step.

This will expose the broker transactions for easy inspection: https://minitex-training-broker.reshare-dev.indexdata.com/.

It will also expose the mock. Some useful endpoints are to display the directory: https://minitex-training-mock.reshare-dev.indexdata.com/directory/entries. Or to use the form endpoint to craft an ISO18626 protocol message for testing: https://minitex-training-mock.reshare-dev.indexdata.com/form.


## Appendix

### Final manifests
A copy of all the final state of manifests used in this training is available for inspection at: resources/final-manifests/minitex-training. Note that the namespace used here is "minitex-training". Be sure to update the namespace and any cluster specific configuration (i.e. load balancer names) before using these in your own configuration.

### Yarn v1
The ReShare and FOLIO projects use yarn version 1 as a javascript package manager. Install yarn version one using these instructions: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

### Run a debug pod
You can run a pod in your cluster to get a shell for debugging. For example:
```
kubectl -n reshare-dev run --rm -it --restart=Never debug --image=alpine:latest sh
```

### HTTPpie
This document uses HTTPie as the command line http client for examples. Curl or another option could be used as well. More information about HTTPie is here: https://httpie.io/cli.
